# Typewriter

A browser editor patterened after medium.com's editor described here in https://medium.com/medium-eng/why-contenteditable-is-terrible-122d8a40e480.

Typewriter keeps an object model representing the text of the document ensuring it will always contain the supported HTML and nothing more.

This was pulled from another project and likely needs cleaning up to be used. There are still things needing to be finished such as:
* cleaning paste operations from other sources (such as MS Word)
* supporting OL and UL items as blocks
